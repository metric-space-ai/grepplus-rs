//! Erlang — onboarded via the parallel-safe registry (`crate::registry`). This
//! whole file is the entire surface: it declares the spec + queries + grammar
//! and self-registers with `inventory::submit!`. No shared file is edited
//! (build.rs discovers this module automatically); the only Cargo.toml line
//! added is the `tree-sitter-erlang` dependency.
//!
//! Status: **experimental**. The `tree-sitter-erlang` grammar models a function
//! definition as a `fun_decl` wrapping one or more `function_clause` nodes, and
//! it carries the function name on the `function_clause`'s `name:` field (an
//! `atom`) — NOT on the `fun_decl`. With the `Capture` name strategy the def
//! node is therefore the `function_clause` (the `@name` atom's parent), so a
//! single `DefRule::func("function_clause")` emits one Function per clause.
//! This grammar also splits a multi-clause function (`f(0) -> …; f(N) -> …`)
//! into SEPARATE `fun_decl`s each holding one `function_clause`, so a
//! multi-clause function yields one Function node per clause (same name, same
//! qname) — an intentional, harmless over-count.
//!
//! Because `function_clause` DOES expose a `name:` field, the engine's
//! enclosing-callable resolution succeeds, so CALLS edges whose source is an
//! Erlang function ARE resolved (unlike Julia). Call extraction captures the
//! callee `atom` in a `call` node's `expr:` position; for a remote call
//! (`mod:fun(…)`) the inner `call` still carries `expr: (atom "fun")`, so the
//! function segment is captured while the module qualifier is dropped
//! (best-effort).
//!
//! Erlang does not run through the generic `spec_extract` path — the
//! `Language::Registered("erlang")` arm in `extract.rs` dispatches to the
//! bespoke `extract_erlang`, which handles the Erlang-specific passes
//! (`type_alias` → Type, `record_decl` / `pp_define` → Variable, same-file-only
//! CALLS mirrored as THROWS, and the `atom`/`var` USAGE walk). The spec/queries
//! below are retained for the registry declaration (grammar + extensions) but
//! are NOT consulted for extraction. One structure we deliberately do not model
//! is the `-module(x)` self-import (a self-referential IMPORTS edge onto the
//! file's own Module node): greppy's importable-symbol IMPORTS resolver never
//! targets a structural Module node and drops self-loops, so this "import →
//! File/Module" case is out of scope without indexer changes.
